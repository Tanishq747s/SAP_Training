- High bIased
- Labelled data
- Supervised Learning Algorithms:	Linear Regression: Data should be linear (x is directly prop. to y)
						y = mx + c
						m = (summation symbol)(x - x')(y - y')   where, '=mean
						Q. Which plot should you use to show correlation between 2 variables. Ans: Scatter Plot
						Even if the data is not linear, it can be done linear using log tranformation

						- MAE- Mean Absolutle Error   	(~Summation of value~)(y - y')/n   y = actual value  y' = prediced value
						- Mean Square Error		(~Summation of value~)(y - y')^2/n   y = actual value  y' = prediced value
						- RMSE Root Mean Square Error
						- R^2				It is used to check the efficiency of the model				
						- Adjusted R
						
					Multiple linear regression: Whne there are more than one columns

					Logistic Regression


- Mean is generally not preferred when removing outlier values, mode is preferred

- High biased: It is not wokring on itws own data
