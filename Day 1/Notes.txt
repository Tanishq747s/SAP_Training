Data Analyst:
	- They provide the data insights(important suggestions)

Data Analytics with coding libraries: numpy, pandas
Language: Python
Tools: Power BI, Tableu, Alteryx(for other countries)
Big Data technologies (work on big data)
Big data: Data is distributed among clusters
DFS: Distributed file system used in big data
Big Data architecture: 	- Hadoop(1.0,2.0,3.0, drawbacks overcomeas version increased)
			- Spark (Used in batch Processing(data is alredy stored somewhere) and Stream processing(generally spark is used for streaming application), 
				ex: Matches streaming online)(Edge computing: auto drive cars)
				Limitation: Nearby Streaming
			- Flink: Does both batch and realtime processing, removes drawback of spark (specifically used for actual streaming)

- Docker Image
- Cloudera
- Work on clustering part if you want to work on Bid Data Technologies
- Cassandra
- Hbase
- SQL (Sii-Q-L)

- languages for big data: Python, Scala (easy of u know Java)
- U shoudl know how to integrate spark and scala (high level)
- dvc: Data versioning control
- Search up about dvc on yt
- DVC: add in resume
- LISP
- PROLOG
- scikit learn:  https://scikit-learn.org/stable/


-Reinformecemnt Learning: Robotics, Gaming


- MACHINE LEARNING
	- Azure ML Studio
	- Auto ML


My Notes:
- Search about alteryx (12LPA packages)
- We worked on 80gb od dataset
