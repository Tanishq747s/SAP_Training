					UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

1] K-Means
- Decide value of K urself
- datapath of clusters will try to find them near centroid
- Clustering is used
- Number of clusters are decided using elbow method
- WCSS (intertia) - Within clustem sum of square
- algorithms where we calculate distance, needs scaling down
- to draw elbow curve we need inertia and number of clusters
- tSNE, PCS is used for Dimensionality Reduction
- PCS: Represent higher data into lower data  

2] NLP
- Lemmetizaton is used if you want an output that you can read
